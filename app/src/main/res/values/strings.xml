    <string name="tuning">What these sleep experiments are for, is to test the options that might work best for you to sleep better. You already sleep every day so you already have lots of practice sleeping - the goal in these experiments is to help you dial in ways that will help you sleep better.</string>
    <string name="sleepDescription">According to National Sleep Foundations, sleep hygiene is a variety of different practices and habits that are necessary to have good nighttime sleep quality and full daytime alertness. Obtaining healthy sleep is important for both physical and mental health. It can also improve productivity and overall quality of life. Everyone, from children to older adults, can benefit from developing a good sleep practice.</string>
    <string name="ourMissionn">Our mission with Sleep Better is to help you and guide you through a series of experiments that are proved to let you explore sleep hygiene. The Sleep Better app offers an easy-to-use, straightforward, friendly interface for you to use that would not only drive you through a self-experimentation tuning process but also help us identify the most impactful factors over your sleeping hygiene.</string>


    <string name="appIntro">Welcome! Sleep Better is a mobile application that guides you through a series of experiments that you can run in a definite period of time in order to start a tuning process over your sleeping patterns.
You will be able to change/choose your experiment once every 5 days, where at the end of each day you will have to log on your experience. You will also be able to analyse the data and interact with the other features of the app.
