    <string name="sleepHygienetitle">Sleep Hygiene?</string>
    <string name="tuningTitle">Tuning?</string>
    <string name="tuning">Tuning is about the options you have towards self-exploration - having the knowledge, the skills and the context to find what best works for you. It is more complex than behavior change as it addresses the whole environment and it is not straightly associated with the individual.</string>
    <string name="sleepDescription">According to National Sleep Foundations, sleep hygiene is a variety of different practices and habits that are necessary to have good nighttime sleep quality and full daytime alertness. Obtaining healthy sleep is important for both physical and mental health. It can also improve productivity and overall quality of life. Everyone, from children to older adults, can benefit from practicing good sleep habits.</string>
    <string name="ourMissionn">Our mission with Sleep Better is to help you and guide you through a series of experiments that are proved to have an impact over your sleep hygiene. We want to confer an easy-to-use, straightforward, friendly interface for you to use that would not only drive you through a self-experimentation tuning process but also help us identify the most impactful factors over your sleeping hygiene.</string>


    <string name="appIntro">Welcome! Sleep Better is a mobile application that guides you through a series of experiments that you can run in a definite period of time in order to start a tuning process over your sleeping patterns.</string>

    <string name="ourMissionTitle">Our Mission?</string>

    <string name="whatExeriments">WHAT EXPERIMENTS AND FEATURES?</string>
    <string name="experimentsTitle">Experiments</string>
    <string name="experiments">For the duration of the self-experimentation study, you will be able to choose which experiments you wish to conduct among the 10 options you have. At every 5 days, you will be required to either change the experiment or stick with it for another 5 days. You will be able to look at the data concerning your well-being in the DATA meu.</string>
    <string name="experiments2">The experiments will be split into 3 categories - LIGHT, CAFFEINE and SLEEP SCHEDULE. Each of them cover a different contextual factor  that has a direct impact on your sleep hygiene.\n  - Light looks at how either sunlight exposure and blue light impact your sleeping patterns;\n  - Caffeine looks at how drugs impact your system when it comes to bedtime;\n  - Sleep Schedule looks at how important a persistent schedule is towards a good seep.</string>
    <string name="loggingTitle">Logging</string>
    <string name="loggingExp">At the end of each day, you will be required to complete 2 short questionnaires (2-3 minutes in total) that would look at both how you approached the experiment in that day AND what is the outcome. The experiment logging asks you to rate whether you feel better/worse than yesterday, but also to answer a short series of questions on how you approached the chosen experiment (1-3 questions).</string>

    <string name="featuresTitle">Other Features</string>
